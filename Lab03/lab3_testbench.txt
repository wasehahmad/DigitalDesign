NEED TO DO





IMPLEMENTED

12. When nothing is being transmitted, TXEN is low, TXD is high, and RDY is high

1.  Ready is high at the beginning of transmission of the 8th bit
2.  Ready is low from bits 0-6 of the transmission
3.  Ready is high when notihng is being transmitted

4.  TXEN should be low when nothing is being transmitted
5.  TXEN is high until the end of the EOF

6.  When TXD is 0, the first half of the bit is low, sencond half is high (10 us == 1000 clock cycles???)
7.  When TXD is 1, the first half of the bit is high, sencond half is low (10 us == 1000 clock cycles???)
8.  Total byte time is 160 us (16000 clock cycles??)
9.  TXD matches data (test first 2 bits and last 2 bits)
10. Transmission of 2 bytes takes 320 us (32000 clock cycles)
11. At the end of the byte when send is low, TXD is high for two cycles (EOF) and TXEN is high as well
